        <p>
            There's a ton of information accessible through the office of the registrar page.
            This page is an attempt at synthesizing some of the Fall 2025 data.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the data in this set was collected through a Python script using the princeton MobileApp API (<a href = "https://tigerapps.org/resources/">more information</a>).

            This graph shows information about courses throughout the course of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
            The exact value plotted can be varied:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Course Count: The number of courses one could potentially take.</li>
            <li>Enrollment: The number of students (supposed to be) in class.</li>
            <li>Capacity: How many students could be in class.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Certain departments can be selected to see information about only classes offered by that department.
            Note that this refers to courses offered primarily by the department and doesn't include cross-listed courses.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "normalize outputs" option will stretch subjects' graphs so that they are all the same height.
            This may help with comparing the time people take classes in a department.

            This is the distribution of the course numbers chosen for classes.
            The gap at the end is the jump from 500 level courses to 1000 level courses.
            Currently unfinished--Sorry there's no labels.

            Cumulative class time refers to the total time students spend in class.
            This can be thought of as the area under the enrollment curve in the previous graph.
