    <div class = "description">
        <p>
            Princeton’s Office of the Registrar contains a large amount of publicly accessible information.
            This page is an attempt at synthesizing some of the data on the Fall 2025 semester.
        </p>
        <p>
            All data was collected using a Python script querying the Princeton MobileApp API
            (<a href = "https://tigerapps.org/resources/">more information</a>).
        </p>

    <div class = "description">
        <p>
            This visualization shows how courses are distributed throughout the day.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can choose which value to plot:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Course Count: The number of courses offered at a given time.</li>
            <li>Enrollment: The number of students expected to be in class.</li>
            <li>Capacity: The maximum number of students that could be in class.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can also filter by department.
            This excludes cross-listed courses listed as belonging to another department.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "normalize outputs" option will scale each department's graph so that they are all the same height.
            This may make cross-department timing comparisons easier.

        <p>
            This is the distribution of the course numbers chosen for classes.
            The gap at the end is the jump from 500 level courses to 1000 level courses.

        <p>
            This table summarizes several statistics about each department's course offerings.
            Click any column header to sort by that field.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Total Instruction Time</strong> refers to the total time spent by instructors teaching each week.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cumulative Class Time</strong> refers to the total time students spend in class.
            Conceptually, this value can be thought of as being the hours of instruction weighted by enrollment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Efficiency</strong> is the Cumulative Class Time / Instruction Time, which represents how many times the content is being duplicated by being listened to multiple people.
            This is similar to the average student count per section, but it isn't particularly beneficial to think about it that way.
